<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr>
<p style = "padding-left: 1em">The concept of washing one's body has been a universal concept throughout human history and its cultures. What it means to be for a person to be clean and to actively clean themself is inherently subjective, but it is generally believed that doing it right brings about good health benefits. This is true, especially given the advancements in science and medicine, and is widely backed up by scientific evidence.<br><br>
							   However...there is a construction of evidence that points to a caveat in this. Most modern kinds of soap and bodywash actually have a variety of harmful substances that can potentially leave users with chronic issues. While it is better to use these than to never bathe, these substances that they contain can ironically make us less healthy and more prone to health-related issues if not dealth with soon.<br><br>
							   <b>Is the convenience of the availability of these worth the risk of washing unhealthy substances onto ourselves, defeating the age-old meaning of body washing?</b><br><br>
							   This website is to educate viewers on what these substances are, what risks they possess, and to point to alternative types or methods that avoid using these as best as possible.</p><br>

<section id = "substances">
<h2>Harmful Substances</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)</h3>
<hr id = "substanceLine1"><br>
<p>One of the most common substances found in types of bodywash. It is an anionic surfacant used to bind ingredients and create a lather that removes bacteria, fat, and oils from the skin. Despite the limitation of its amount in most products today, at least in the U.S., frequent use of it and exposure to the body has been commonly sited to cause skin irritation, severe eye damage, and permanent hair loss.</p><br>
<h3>Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)</h3>
<hr id = "substanceLine2"><br>
<p>Similar to SLS and as common, but depending on how it's manufactured, it can contain 1,4-dioxane, a chemical known to cause liver and kidney damage, as well as the demyelination and edema of the brain if exposed to lethal amounts in a short amount of time.</p><br>
<h3>Parabens</h3>
<hr id = "substanceLine3"><br>
<p>Group of chemicals commonly used for their antibacterial and preservational properties that have the products containing them last longer and be more effective. Studies have shown that besides causing skin irritation, they can also cause hormonal imbalances, causing infertility and harm to reproductive organs. The chances of the latter two happening increase when users are exposed to them for life-long periods.</p><br>
<h3>Triclosan</h3>
<hr id = "substanceLine4"><br>
<p>An antimicrobial agent classified as a pesticide by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). High doses of exposure to this can cause liver cancer, reproductive harm, and weaken the cardiovascular system.</p><br>
<h3>Synthetic Fragrances</h3>
<hr id = "substanceLine5"><br>
<p>Any kind of chemical made and used to make products have a pleasant smell. Most synthetically made ones are derived from petroleum, and can be carcinogenic, causing breast and liver cancer, as well as induce toxic teratogenic side effects.</p><br>
<h3>Diethanolamine (DEA)</h3>
<hr id = "substanceLine6"><br>
<p>The most known compound of ethanolamines, which are used as surfacants for cleaning products, including bodywash. Is cited to increase risk of contacting high levels of nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens, increasing the risk of contracting liver cancer and Hodgkin disease.</p><br><br>
<p>These ones listed are only the most commonly known substances in our products that can cause harm.<br><br>
   <b>Even with what has already been discovered, new research is being constantly developed to uncover previously unknown risks of other products that we unknowingly use everyday.</b><br><br>
   Being aware and informed of what is known to be dangerous what what has these is key to taking care of oneself even more than just washing.</p><br>
</section>
<section id = "products">
<h2>Products that use them</h2>
<hr>
<p style = "padding-left: 1em">New regulations have made it harder for some substances, such as triclosan and diethanolamines, to be present in products, most products out on the market at least make use of sulfates like SLS's and SLES's. A quick look at ingredient labels at commonly used products like Dove, AXE, Old Spice, and many others will reveal their usage of these.</p><br>
</section>
<section id = "alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<hr>
<p style = "padding-left: 1em">There has been a rising retaliation against the use of these and other substances in the form of individuals selectively buying and making products that still function as bodywash without the harmful substances.<br><br>
							   Brands such as Squatch, NATIVE, and various vegan ingredient-focused brands have made it apart of their image to not only provide these healthier products more readily, but to also educate the public on the risks of these and other known harmful substances.</p><br>
</section>
<section id = "conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
<p style = "padding-left: 1em">Science, technology, and medicine are constantly evolving, as is the general consensus of what it means to cleanly wash ourselves. The more we educate ourselves and instantiate regulations against these substances, in the form of both laws and education, the more we can better develop our individual and general idea of what is good to clean ourselves with.<br><br>
							   Make sure to think for yourself and to take the time to research into these topics if you truly want to know if something is worth using as bodywash...or not.</p><br>
